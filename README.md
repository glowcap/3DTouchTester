There's a fun animated interface to make it interesting! The animations are all coded by hand, but if I were to redo it, I'd use [Facebook Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop)

If 3D touch isn't available on a user's device, it changes to a second timer when the button is tapped.

Known issues:
- Bottom spring automatically resets when returning from background
